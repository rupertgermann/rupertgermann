# Hi, I’m Rupert 👋

I’m an open-source developer with a long background in **TYPO3**
(maintainer of [`tt_news`](https://github.com/rupertgermann/tt_news) since 2004).

Recently, my focus has shifted toward **AI-powered tools** —
and toward **using AI as part of the development process itself**.

I’m exploring how **AI can help us build software that, in turn,
uses AI to support humans in thinking, tracking, and decision-making**.
This includes what I like to call *vibe coding*: fast, iterative,
curiosity-driven development with AI as a collaborator.

## 🧠 Recent projects

- **open recall**  
  An experiment in AI-assisted knowledge recall — exploring how
  ideas, notes, and connections can be resurfaced at the right moment.

- **rowing tracker**  
  A lightweight rowing workout tracker, designed with simplicity in mind
  and room for AI-supported insights.

Both projects are built **with AI** and are **about AI** —
not as a gimmick, but as a practical tool for solving real problems.

## 🛠 Interests & tools

- PHP / TYPO3 / MySQL
- JavaScript (modern ES)
- APIs & system integration
- Legacy systems & sustainable evolution
- AI-assisted development
- Human-centric AI software

Based in Düsseldorf, Germany.
