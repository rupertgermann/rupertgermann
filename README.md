# Hi, I’m Rupert 👋

I’m a developer with a long background in **TYPO3 and open-source software**  
(maintaining `tt_news` since 2004) and a growing interest in **small, focused tools**.

Lately, I’ve been exploring **vibe coding** and what it means to
**utilize AI — including AI-written code — in real projects**.

## 🧪 Recent projects

- **open recall**  
  A personal knowledge & recall experiment, exploring how ideas, notes,
  and connections can be resurfaced meaningfully.

- **rowing tracker**  
  A lightweight tracker for rowing workouts — built for clarity,
  simplicity, and personal use.

Both projects lean heavily on **AI-assisted development** and are part
of my ongoing exploration of how humans and AI can co-create software.
